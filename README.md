## Hi I'm Chirag

Not really sure how you ended up here, but welcome.

I'm a backend developer, mostly working with **Laravel** and **JavaScript**, building APIs, integrations, and systems that are supposed to survive more than just the first release.

## About me

Full‑stack developer with 10+ years in web development and 5+ in Laravel. I've built real‑world systems around payments, external APIs, background jobs, and data syncing, and I've worked with Nova, Vapor, Forge, Sail, Redis, and Docker. I care about readable APIs, reliable databases, and things not breaking quietly in production—**maintainability** over clever solutions. I'm comfortable in remote‑first teams.

## Tech I work with

- **Backend**: PHP, Laravel, Node.js, Go  
- **Laravel**: InertiaJS, Livewire, Nova, Vapor, Forge, Sail, Horizon  
- **Frontend**: Vue 3, React, AlpineJS, TailwindCSS  
- **Databases**: MySQL, Redis  
- **Infra**: Docker, CI/CD  
- **Cloud / services**: AWS, DigitalOcean  
- **Payments**: Stripe  
- **Testing**: PestPHP, PHPUnit
